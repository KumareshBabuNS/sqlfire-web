1. It will be nice if the various data loading - exporting, importing utilities available via 
the 'sqlf' command line is also incorporated. i.e. DDLUtils commands
2. Will be nice to add admin capabilities like - backup, restore, etc. Maybe, just have to provide 
a server side destination directory.
3. Add to reports queries such as show

  - view async event listener for TABLE (Table queries)
